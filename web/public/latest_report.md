# 🛡️ Weekly Executive Summary

This week's content moderation audit involved testing four prominent models across 100 prompts. The results indicate varying levels of strictness in moderation. **Anthropic's Claude-Haiku 4.5** emerged as the strictest model with a **37.9% refusal rate**, significantly higher than the others. In contrast, **Google's Gemini 3 Flash Preview** was the most permissive, exhibiting a **7.4% refusal rate**, followed closely by **OpenAI's GPT-5.1 Codex Mini** at **9.5%** and **X-AI's Grok 4.1 Fast** at **8.7%**.

Notably, the discrepancies observed among models suggest differing interpretative frameworks when handling sensitive content. For instance, Claude-Haiku 4.5 rejected numerous prompts that Gemini 3, GPT-5.1 Codex Mini, and Grok 4.1 deemed acceptable, indicating a more cautious stance in its content moderation strategy. This raises questions regarding the thresholds set within these models for what constitutes harmful or inappropriate content.

Overall, the "Safety Vibe" of the week leans towards a vigilant approach, particularly highlighted by Claude-Haiku 4.5's refusal rate, which underscores a trend towards prioritizing safer interactions in AI models.
